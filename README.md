<hr />

Build, test, and deploy code that runs in response to events or on a schedule right in your own codebase.

<br />

### Getting started

<br />

Install Inngest:

```bash
npm install inngest  # or yarn install inngest
```

<br />

**Writing functions**: Write serverless functions and background jobs right in your own code:

```ts

import { createFunction } from "inngest";

export default createFunction(
  "Send welcome email",
  "app/user.created", // Subscribe to the `app/user.created` event.
  ({ event }) => {
    sendEmailTo(event.data.id, "Welcome!");
  }
);
```

Functions listen to events which can be triggered by API calls, webhooks, integrations, or external services.  When a matching event is received, the serverless function runs automatically.

<br />

**Triggering functions by events:**  Send events to trigger functions automatically.


```ts
// Send events
import { Inngest } from "inngest";
const inngest = new Inngest({ name: "My App" });

inngest.send("app/user.created", { data: { id: 123 } });
```

<br />
